### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### My name is Aditya Salman, you can call me Adit

I am a graduate of bachelor's degree in informatics living in Cirebon, Indonesia. Previously I was a Desktop Developer (C#) and then decided to swerve into the world of Mobile Development, especially Android, whether this is a wrong or right decision, but clearly I really enjoy and am grateful for what I'm doing for now.

For my repository, it's really small because I rarely upload projects from articles I've studied, especially the repository regarding C# programming I've deleted because it's my past, I hope you who read this can understand and understand it.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on **Neurabot** as **Android Developer**
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about **Kotlin** on **Android Development**
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Andorid Development and Copywriting
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aditya-salman-ba2750196/) | [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/as_marimo/)
- ðŸ˜„ I like reading books about self-development and history in my spare time
- âš¡ Fun fact: My first line of code was not "Hello World!"
